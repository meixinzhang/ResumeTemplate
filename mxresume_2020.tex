\section*{Relevant Experiences}
\runsubsection{Google}%
\multidescript{\GBar Software Engineer Intern}{Python, GCP}
\info{Mountain View, CA (Remote)}{May -- August 2020}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
\item Implemented additional features for handling multi-tensor models in the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) inference component, expanding TFX and TFLite use-cases
\item Redesigned the TFX inference component to run on Arrow RecordBatch, achieving pipeline input standardization and improving modular space-time efficiency by 20\textsc{\%}
\item Developed a utility module to transform RecordBatch to JSON strings, which supports inference for models stored in remote locations
\end{tightemize}
%
\runsubsection{Deloitte}%
\multidescript{\GBar Data Scientist Intern}{Python, SQL}
\info{Toronto, ON}{January -- April 2020}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
\item Developed a full data science pipeline for forecasting COVID-19 hospital equipment demand using a regression model with interactions, achieving an accuracy of 92\textsc{\%}
\item Proposed and built significant features in an interpretable regression model that identifies driving factors for prescriptions, leading to valuable insights for the client
\item Developed generalized exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts and a cross-validation module for the internal cross-client codebase, reducing task completion time by 50\textsc{\%}
\end{tightemize}
%
\runsubsection{Hubdoc}%
\multidescript{\GBar Robot Platform Software Developer Intern}{JavaScript, Node.js}
\info{Toronto, ON}{January -- April 2019}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
\item Redesigned and refactored asynchronous scraping scripts and processing algorithms, leading to improvement of robot efficiency and success rates by as much as 80\textsc{\%}
\item Trained neural networks to localize login fields and developed a model to classify login states with 90\textsc{\%} accuracy, further automating the document fetching process
\end{tightemize}

\section*{Projects}
\runsubsection{IPlanner}%
\multidescript{\GBar Interactive Agile Planner}{\Csharp}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
\item Researched and implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using \Csharp\ to narrow down the most influential factors for the success/failure of a sprint
\item Analyzed program outputs and presented new evaluation methods and critical success factors for Agile practices in 20\texttt{+} teams
\end{tightemize}
%
\runsubsection{WATonomous}%
\multidescript{\GBar Autonomous Vehicle Path-Planning}{\Cpp, ROS}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
\item Developed software for a Chevrolet Bolt competing in the GM/SAE Autodrive Challenge using weight-based cost map evaluation and D* route planning algorithms
\item Implemented a parameter server compatible with ROS to update program constants at runtime, reducing 20\texttt{+} hours of recompiling time at testing during release cycles
\end{tightemize}
%
\runsubsection{ParkIt}%
\multidescript{\GBar Elle Hacks -- Automated Parking System}{JavaScript, Node.js}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
\item Designed and built a web app that integrates machine vision and a cloud platform for licence plate recognition, automating payments, and storing parking history
\item Implemented RESTful API endpoints with Node.js to facilitate real-time communication between the hardware, user portal, and database
\end{tightemize}
%
\runsubsection{CQA-19}%
\multidescript{\GBar COVID-19 Question Answering Machine}{Python}
\begin{tightemize}{5mm}
